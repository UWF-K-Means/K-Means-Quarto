The K-Means algorithm relies on Euclidean distance as a measure of similarity between data objects.In this context, similarity is inversely related to the Euclidean distance; in other words, the smaller the distance, the greater the similarity between objects. To initiate the algorithm, you must specify the initial number of clusters (k) and their initial centers. The algorithm then iteratively adjusts these cluster centers based on the similarity between data objects and cluster centers. Clustering continues until the objective function converges, signaling the end of the process and yielding the final result.

The formula for calculating the Euclidean distance between a data object and a cluster center can be expressed as follows:

d(x,Ci)=sqrt(∑j=1 to k (xj−Cij)2)
