The k-means algorithm for partitioning can be executed in 5 main steps.

1.  Partition $N$ objects, or observations, into $K$ nonempty subsets. Each cluster must not be empty and will have a different classification. This is $K$, if $k=4$ that means there will be four clusters.

2.  Then compute seed points, which are randomly assigned reference points called centroids. In @fig-centroids $k=4$ and are highlighted in green.

3.  Assign each object to the cluster with the nearest assigned centroid. @fig-centroids shows the Euclidean distance calculation as a line connecting each observation to one of the 4 centroids.

4.  Adjust the centroid location using the Euclidean distance formula to minimize the distance of each data observation to its assigned centroid. @fig-clusters shows how the Euclidean distance drives some cluster members to reassign to a new cluster, influencing the centroids positions. This updates the cluster mean, $\mu_i$, in turn relocating the centroids from where they were seen in @fig-centroids.

5.  The final step is to repeat steps 2-4 until there is no change in distance between the observations and the centroids.

The result uncovers 4 distinct clusters containing the most similar observations within groups.
