abstract = {This paper introduces k′-means algorithm that performs correct clustering without pre-assigning the exact number of clusters. This is achieved by minimizing a suggested cost-function. The cost-function extends the mean-square-error cost-function of k-means. The algorithm consists of two separate steps. The first is a pre-processing procedure that performs initial clustering and assigns at least one seed point to each cluster. During the second step, the seed-points are adjusted to minimize the cost-function. The algorithm automatically penalizes any possible winning chances for all rival seed-points in subsequent iterations. When the cost-function reaches a global minimum, the correct number of clusters is determined and the remaining seed points are located near the centres of actual clusters. The simulated experiments described in this paper confirm good performance of the proposed algorithm.}

The K-means method is first introduced, various formulations of the minimum variance loss function and alternative loss functions within the same class are outlined, and different methods of choosing the number of clusters and initialization, variable preprocessing, and data reduction schemes are discussed. Theoretic statistical results are provided and various extensions of K-means using different metrics or modifications of the original algorithm are given, leading to a unifying treatment of K-means and some of its extensions. Finally, several future studies are outlined that could enhance the understanding of numerous subtleties affecting the performance of the K-means method. PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract={The K-means algorithm is a popular data-clustering algorithm. However, one of its drawbacks is the requirement for the number of clusters, K, to be specified before the algorithm is applied. This paper first reviews existing methods for selecting the number of clusters for the algorithm. Factors that affect this selection are then discussed and a new measure to assist the selection is proposed. The paper concludes with an analysis of the results of using the proposed measure to determine the number of clusters for the K-means algorithm for different data sets.},

abstract = {Clustering is an explorative data analysis technique used for investigating the underlying structure in the data. It described as the grouping of objects, where the objects share similar characteristics. Over the past 50 years, clustering has been widely applied to atmospheric science data in particular, climate and meteorological data. Since the 1980's, air pollution studies began employing clustering techniques, and has since been successful, and the aim of this paper is to provide a review of such studies. In particular, two well known and commonly used clustering methods i.e. k-means and hierarchical agglomerative, that have been applied in air pollution studies have been reviewed. Air pollution data from two sources i.e. ground-based monitoring stations and air mass trajectories depicting pollutant pathways, have been included. Research works that have focused on spatio-temporal characteristics of air pollutants, pollutant behavior in terms of source, transport pathways, apportionment and links to meteorological conditions, comprise much of the research works reviewed. A total of 100 research articles were included during the period of 1980–2019. The purpose of the clustering approach, the specific technique used and the data to which it was applied constitute much of the discussion presented in this review. Overall, the k-means technique has been extensively used among the studies, while average and Ward linkages were the most frequently applied hierarchical clustering techniques. Reviews of clustering techniques applied in air pollution studies are currently lacking and this paper aims to fill that gap. In addition, and to the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first review dedicated to clustering applications in air pollution studies, and the first that covers the longest time span (1980–2019).}

ABSTRACT={The K-means algorithm is a widely used clustering algorithm that offers simplicity and efficiency. However, the traditional K-means algorithm uses a random method to determine the initial cluster centers, which make clustering results prone to local optima and then result in worse clustering performance. In this research, we propose an adaptive initialization method for the K-means algorithm (AIMK) which can adapt to the various characteristics in different datasets and obtain better clustering performance with stable results. For larger or higher-dimensional datasets, we even leverage random sampling in AIMK (name as AIMK-RS) to reduce the time complexity. 22 real-world datasets were applied for performance comparisons. The experimental results show AIMK and AIMK-RS outperform the current initialization methods and several well-known clustering algorithms. Specifically, AIMK-RS can significantly reduce the time complexity to O (n). Moreover, we exploit AIMK to initialize K-medoids and spectral clustering, and better performance is also explored. The above results demonstrate superior performance and good scalability by AIMK or AIMK-RS. In the future, we would like to apply AIMK to more partition-based clustering algorithms to solve real-life practical problems.}

ABSTRACT = {Supplier evaluation and selection is one of the most critical strategic decisions for developing a competitive and sustainable organization. Companies have to consider supplier related risks and threats in their purchasing decisions. In today’s competitive and risky business environment, it is very important to work with reliable suppliers. This study proposes a clustering based approach to group suppliers based on their risk profile. Suppliers of a company in the heavy-machinery sector are assessed based on 17 qualitative and quantitative risk types. The weights of the criteria are determined by using the Best-Worst method. Four factors are extracted by applying Factor Analysis to the supplier risk data. Then k-means clustering algorithm is applied to group core suppliers of the company based on the four risk factors. Three clusters are created with different risk exposure levels. The interpretation of the results provides insights for risk management actions and supplier development programs to mitigate supplier risk.},

  abstract  = {Set-to-set face recognition has drawn much attention thanks to
               its rich set information. We propose a robust and efficient
               Set-to-Set Nearest Neighbor Classification (S2S-NNC) approach
               for face recognition by using the maximum weighted correlation
               between sets in low-dimensional projection subspaces. A pair of
               face sets is represented as two sets of Mutual Typical Samples
               (MTS) based on their maximum weighted correlation, and the S2S
               distance is equivalent to that between two sets of MTS. For the
               variation of objects within a set, the faces are partitioned
               into patches and projected onto a correlation subspace to find
               the MTS between two sets. Furthermore, we develop a S2S-NNC
               approach for image set-based face recognition. Compared with
               existing approaches, the S2S-NNC unifies the image-to-image,
               image-to-set and set-to-set recognition problems into one model.
               Experimental results show the S2S-NNC approach significantly
               outperforms the state-of-art approaches on large video samples

abstract={Cyber crime is a worldwide problem, with a global reach. Cyber crimes do not respect national boundaries, and so can be sent to and from anywhere in the world. Many reports, mostly by cyber security firms, regularly release information ranking the different nations in terms of top cyber crime output, broken down into varying cyber crime types. However, little has been done to classify nations according to separate cyber crime typologies using any multivariate methods. Instead, reporting is descriptive and unidimensional. The present research sought to fill this gap by conducting K-means clustering analysis on a sample of 190 countries using seven dimensions of cyber crime ranging from malware, fraud, spam, and digital piracy, as well as measures of GDP and internet use. The findings determined that nations can be broken down into four distinct categories based on cyber crime activity: low cyber crime countries, non-serious cyber crime countries, advance fee fraud countries, and phishing scam countries. The implications of these findings and the directions for future research are discussed.},

With the development of technology applications, the requirements for accuracy and anti-counterfeiting of face recognition are also increasing.

Lastly, the SVM method is used to classify. The results show that the K-mean method can achieve high recognition performance with fewer feature numbers.},

abstract = { Battery failure has traditionally been a major concern for electric vehicle (EV) safety, and early fault diagnosis will reduce many EV safety accidents. However, the short-circuit signal is generally very weak, so it is still a challenge to achieve a timely warning of battery failure. In this paper, an initial microfault diagnosis method is proposed for the data of electric vehicles in actual operation. First, a robust locally weighted regression data smoothing method is proposed that can effectively remove noisy data and retain fault characteristics. Second, an ordinary-least-squares-based voltage potential feature extraction method is proposed, which can effectively capture the small fault features of battery cells and achieve early warning. Third, a reference cell selection method based on K-means clustering is proposed, which can effectively reduce the false alarms caused by the inconsistency of each cell. Fourth, the Fréchet algorithm is introduced into the field of battery pack fault diagnosis and combined with thresholds for battery pack fault diagnosis and localization to accomplish the diagnosis and early warning of minor faults. Finally, the fault diagnosis method is validated by three actual running electric vehicles to verify the effectiveness, reliability, and robustness of the method. }
