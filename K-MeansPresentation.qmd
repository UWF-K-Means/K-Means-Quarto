##An Introduction to K-Means Clustering

::: incremental
Finding meaningful patterns within data has become unobtrusive as data collection and management continues to grow

. . .

K-Means Clustering caters to such voluminous data, utilizing

-   unsupervised learning
-   clustering
-   variance minimization techniques

. . .

We will explain the K-Means Clustering method by analyzing customer segmentation of an eCommerce data set.

We will show how K-Means may be used to classify consumer bases into discrete clusters based on shared characteristics in e-commerce data sets.

We will begin by introducing the components of K-Means Clustering, including the 5 main steps to execute the method.

##Unsupervised learning

-The K-means method is considered unsupervised machine learning because the outcome is rather data driven , which is preferred as the formulation can be adjusted based on any changing dimensions in data.

-Used when data is to be categorized or grouped without the assistance of historical results or human intervention.

-One of the longer-standing methods of autonomous data categorization comes in the form of the K-Means Clustering algorithm, and is generally selected for its simplicity and speed (Å½alik 2008).

## Clustering

The goal of clustering is to create partitions in the data that are meaningful.
There are many methods to choose from to evaluate metrics for clustering.


## Euclidean Distance and Finding K

This analysis uses Euclidean Distance

- Euclidean distance can be employed as a key metric to measure the dissimilarity between data points, facilitating the grouping of similar data instances into clusters using the k-means clustering algorithm. 

- In this context, similarity is inversely related to the Euclidean distance; in other words, the smaller the distance, the greater the similarity between objects. T

##Method Steps

To initiate the algorithm, you must specify the initial number of clusters 
 and their initial centers.
