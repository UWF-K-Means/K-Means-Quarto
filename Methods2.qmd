# Euclidean Distance & Finding K {.unnumbered}

The formula for calculating the Euclidean distance between a data object and a cluster center can be expressed as follows:\
$$
d(x,C_i)=sqrt(\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_jâˆ’C_{ij})^2)
$$\
Objective function: The k-means clustering objective is to minimize the within-cluster variance. It is formulated as - \
$$
d(x,C_i)=(\sum_{i=1}^{k}*\sum_{x \in C_i}^{}(||x-\mu_i||)^2)
$$

Where:\
$k$ is the number of clusters.

$C_i$ represents the number of points in the cluster $i$

$\mu_i$ represents the centroid mean of cluster $i$

The objective function is the sum of squared Euclidean distances from each point in a cluster to its centroid. The goal is to find cluster assignments and centroids that minimize this objective.

To determine $k$, the number of clusters to initially set, there are a few approaches such as the empirical, elbow, and Silhouette methods. The empirical method assigns the number of clusters $\approx \frac{n^{\frac{1}{2}}}{2}$ for a data set of $n$ observations. The elbow method is based on the idea that increasing the number of clusters, $k$, will reduce the sum of within-cluster variance. After plotting the sum of within-cluster variances as a function of the number of clusters $K$, the inflection point is determined using the turning point in the curve.
